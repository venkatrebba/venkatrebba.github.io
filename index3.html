											<h3 class="major"> Video Quality Assessment </h3>
											<p> I worked as a team lead for this project. I developed the state of art deep learning models for detecting quality corruptions of display
                                                while playing a multi-media content on it . We accounted all the possible display corruptions like blurness, flickering, green corruptions,
                                                black, bsod, freezing.

                        												
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
												In order to record the display screen, we used logitech cameras and the camera recordings were pushed for developed models evaulation.
                                                Currently, it cuts the cost for manual verification.

											<p>
                                                Researched and devised deep learning models for assessing the quality of the audio
                                                that comes out from multiple audio interfaces of a PC. 

												Firstly, the audio was captured through audio recording device (Creative Sound Blaster XFi HD).
												Secondly, the recorded audio was sent to deep learning models for quality analysis purpose.

                                                We developed a CRNN model to detect and extract digits in an image.
												
												This solution was used to identify the score of a Game/workbench automatically.
